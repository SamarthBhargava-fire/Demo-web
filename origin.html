The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000 BCE, 
although some models place the common ancestor as far back as 55 million years or more, 
implying long term coevolution with bat and avian species. The most recent common 
ancestor of the alphacoronavirus line has been placed at about 2400 BCE, of the betacoronavirus 
line at 3300 BCE, of the gammacoronavirus line at 2800 BCE, and of the deltacoronavirus line at 
about 3000 BCE. Bats and birds, as warm-blooded flying vertebrates, are an ideal natural reservoir 
for the coronavirus gene pool (with bats the reservoir for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronavirus â€“ 
and birds the reservoir for gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses). The large number and global 
range of bat and avian species that host viruses has enabled extensive evolution and dissemination of coronaviruses.

Many human coronaviruses have their origin in bats.The human coronavirus NL63 shared a common ancestor with a bat 
coronavirus (ARCoV.2) between 1190 and 1449 CE. The human coronavirus 229E shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus 
(GhanaGrp1 Bt CoV) between 1686 and 1800 CE. More recently, alpaca coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E diverged sometime before 1960.
 MERS-CoV emerged in humans from bats through the intermediate host of camels. MERS-CoV, although related to several bat coronavirus 
species, appears to have diverged from these several centuries ago.The most closely related bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV diverged in 1986.
A possible path of evolution of SARS coronavirus and keen bat coronaviruses is that SARS-related coronaviruses coevolved in bats for a long time. 
The ancestors of SARS-CoV first infected leaf-nose bats of the genus Hipposideridae; subsequently, they spread to horseshoe bats in the species 
Rhinolophidae, then to Asian palm civets, and finally to humans.
Unlike other betacoronaviruses, bovine coronavirus of the species Betacoronavirus 1 and subgenus Embecovirus 
is thought to have originated in rodents and not in bats. In the 1790s, equine coronavirus diverged from 
the bovine coronavirus after a cross-species jump. Later in the 1890s, human coronavirus OC43 diverged from bovine 
coronavirus after another cross-species spillover event. It is speculated that the flu pandemic of 1890 may have
 been caused by this spillover event, and not by the influenza virus, because of the related timing, neurological symptoms, 
and unknown causative agent of the pandemic. Besides causing respiratory infections, human coronavirus OC43 is also suspected 
of playing a role in neurological diseases. In the 1950s, the human coronavirus OC43 began to diverge into its present genotypes.
 Phylogentically, mouse hepatitis virus (Murine coronavirus), which infects the mouse's liver and central nervous system,[80] is related to 
human coronavirus OC43 and bovine coronavirus. Human coronavirus HKU1, like the aforementioned viruses, also has its origins in rodents.
